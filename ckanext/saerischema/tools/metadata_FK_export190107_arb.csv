Data, survey coverage and methodology for the period 1997-2013 are considered to be very reliable; historic records are of highly variable reliability and coverage. When running database reports, it is essential to realise that the majority of records document the presence (and occasionally population size) of each species, but that the absence of a species on an island has not been recorded.  Exceptions to this are the records for Norway rat Rattus norvegicus: this is the only species for which records of absence, suspected absence, presence or suspected presence are listed for EVERY island (surveyed and unsurveyed);  these data are considered to be very reliable as sufficient is known about the behaviour and distribution of rats to make a desktop assessment of their likely presence/absnce on islands that have not been surveyed. Records for brown rat Rattus rattus are also very reliable as this species is only known from one island (New Island). Records of presence and absence of mice are also considered to be reliable, but the only islands that have been entered as 'mouse-free' are those known to have breeding Cobb's wren and/or where the absence of mice has been documented in a publication. Therefore, there are many more mouse-free islands than those listed in the database. The records are entered by date of survey, listed under Invasive species in the Visits field. 
Non-native invasive plant records are principally from surveys conducted by Robin Woods (1997-2009) and Sally Poncet and Ken Passfield (2008-2013). The data are reliable for the islands surveyed, but the dataset is incomplete due to lack of survey coverage of all islands. The records are entered by date of survey  (which in the database correspond to the tab called ""visits"").  All common and Latin plant names were taken from the October 2011 plant list compiled by Rebecca Upson (Falklands Conservation). No records from the Falklands Conservation and KEW databases have been included as they are available on separated files. 
There are very few non-native invasive bird data entered in the database. Records are entered by date of survey, listed under Invasive species in the Visits field. Greylag goose is considered an invasive species; house sparrow is not included (but should be).

Hence, the dabase covers a geographic area that comprises Falkland Islands conservation zones (FICZ and FOCZ) and waters outside those areas up to Lat 45 degrees of latitude (towards North) and 54 degrees latitude (towards South). The data were collected regularly from January 1988 in the framework of what is locally called ""the observer programme"". The position data stored in the database corresponds to the positions of fishing vessels such as trawlers, jiggers and longliners while they are fishing. Depth and temperature is taken at every station recorded by the vessels. It is worth mentioning that also CDT's data are collected but are not saved in the database. They can be requested but comes as separated files. Each station has got associated the figures of catches (in kilo), species names, plus sample weight and discard weight if applicable.  The biological data inform on sex, maturity, size and weight of the species sampled by the observers. In addition, age is recorded from the otoliths and there is also other specialisised information (such as fish diet, gonad, liver weight, fish tagging) whose recording has started in the last 13 years. It is worth mentioning that the level of detail of the catches has improved throughout the years since more identification works have been carried out by the observers on board the vessels.

It is important to clarify that the observers are able to record less than what the vessel may actually catch. In addition, it is worth reminding that the vesssel records the catch by day and not by trawls, contrary to what the observers do. Hence due to this discrepancies, the actual number of stations may be less than the actual number of locations where the fish has been caugth. Currently the Falklands fisheries department is working to make a change in the way the vessels log their catches. The aim is to achieve a true picture of where the fish has been caught and enhance the accuracy of the position data of the catches.

In general 500 gr of soil sample is taken and it is considered to be representative of the field. The samples are taken from the paddock using a W ""transect"". The soil sample are then mixed together to get an overall representation of the soil in the paddock. The samples are analysed in the DOA lab using the Palintest complete soil management kit. The volume of the soil sampled is 0.5 ml and it is diluted in deionised water and the following components are tested: pH water and Ca_Cl2, Nitrogen, Ammonia, Olsen_P, Potassium, Sulphur, Magnesium, Calcium, Alluminium, Iron, Cupper, Manganese, Chloride, Conductivity and Soluble salt.  The lab technicians keep a sample book in their offices with indication of all the sample in stock. Usually samples are retained for two years in a glassware store area, some of the oldest samples may be missed. Data are still incomplete. 
All the NA values in the table indicate that no measurament was taken. All the values greater than or minus than a figure indicates that the figure is actually the maximum value measurable for the instrument used in the lab. For instance, if one column has got >25 and also >75 it means that 25 is the maximum value of that chemical component in the sample.

Polygons representing habitat units distinguished by visually assessed differences in colour from GoogleEarth imagery were loaded onto PDA. The survey was conducted by climbing to a high point in order to have a good visibility of the area to be mapped. The view printed from Google Earth was then compared to the habitat on the field to check for appropriateness. 
A walking route through the area was chosen to cover the polygons in the previously produced map. Five square metres quadrats were also analysed as vegetation assessment points (VAPs). A digital photo was taken for each quadrat. The PDA was used while walking through the pre-determined routes to mark plant communities and habitat types. Walking across the island helped as well to record species falling outside the VAPs. This assessment was aimed at recording species with restrivted distributions where small populations may have been present but did not occur within the VAPs. Notice that widespread species that fell within the VAPs were not exhaustively recorded outside. 
Finally, detailed shapes of the plant communities/map units were completed back at the office with a combination of any vertical airphotos that could be opportunistically taken during inward and outward bound helicopter flights.

The shapefile was rasterised to 0.01 degrees i.e. roughly 1000metres. The fetch tool was run in SPM mode i.e. 9 x 3 degree rotation radials x 16 significant wind directions (from 0 to 360 degrees, step 22.5deg). The images show the patterns of distance (degrees) travelled by waves according to the shape of landmasses. For distances originating from the margins of images, increasing negative values are present until a landmass is encountered. Absolute value images for each fetch image for each wind direction were created to eliminate negative travel values. The final result is a weighed sum image of each fetch image for each of the 16 directions was performed (weights according to the annual mean wind distribution chart http://www.windfinder.com/windstatistics/mount_pleasant_falkland).

The results showed that while males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and ability to catch larger prey items.  Ecological niche models,  using MaxEnt modelling, were run to compare the environmental conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes. MaxEnt models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have slightly larger niche width. Smaller dive loggers (TDRs) were used in 2010/11 for comparison to larger GPS data loggers used in all three seasons and we included two categories of control birds: handled controls and PIT control birds that were previously marked with passive integrative transponders (PITs), but which had not been handled during this study. Increased foraging trip duration was only observed in GPS birds during 2010/11, the breeding season in which we also found GPS birds foraging further away from the colony and travelling longer distances. Compared to previous breeding seasons, 2010/11 may have been a period with less favourable environmental conditions, which would enhance the impact of logger attachments. A comparison between GPS and TDR birds showed a significant difference in dive depth frequencies with birds carrying larger GPS data loggers diving shallower.

The study of lifetime individual strategies can greatly help in elucidating some core aspects of the theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. The study has a special focus on behavioural strategies and tactics used to compete, mate, and breed, but we are using a multi-factorial approach, and we are collecting data on the seal structural phenotype (age, size and morphology), on the effect of the spatial and social structure of the population on individual behaviour, on the effects of hormones and physiology at large on behaviour; and on the genetic correlates of the social system. On the applied side, we are producing estimates of population size and trend, vital statistics and life tables, analysis and forecast of population viability, and study of habitat selection and usage.

This is the first study  of the aquatic phase of  elephant seal life cycle that has been carried out in the Falklands. Elephant seals are an important component of the Falklands biodiversity, may represent a conduit for gene flow among the main populations of the South Georgia stock, and are an important resource for wildlife-oriented tourism in the islands. Contrary to our expectations, we found that most females forage rather close to their breeding site and  the Falklands coastline, in concentrated areas, and over rather shallow water. Just few of them show the very long loops that are rather typical of female foraging in other populations (e.g., South Georgia and the Valdes Peninsula). These findings have clear practical and management implications, including a greater responsibility of Falklands authorities and a greater expsosure to human disturbance and threats. There is an urgent needing to carry out a study of the movements at sea during  the post-moulting phase. Further information is available on the research group website, www.eleseal.org.",biota,"Falkland Islands, Sea Lion Island, southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina, foraging areas, tracking at sea, biotelemetry, animal movements",2009-01-01,2011-12-31,2011,"All deployments were carried out at SLI on breeding females  aged 4-12 that were close to weaning of the pup and return to sea.  SPOT5 tag was chosen because it is a simple (location only) and relatively cheap tag of proven reliability that has been frequently deployed on elephant seals. Although precision of Argos positioning is low, it was considered adequate for a  study of foraging area. Females were chemically sedated using a standard protocol (Zoletil, initial intramuscular injection, top up on the extradural vein if required), and were carefully monitored after deployment. All of  them successfully weaned the pup and returned to sea, although one of them was likely predated by killer whales  upon departure. All females returned to the Falklands for the moult, and all tags operated for the full deployment, so we have a final data set of 23 full tracks. More details on the project and protocols are available online at http://www.eleseal.org/.  The Argos data files have been  processed using a set of custom scripts to exclude low quality and erroneous positions, and were analyzed using QGIS and STATA.

The catalogue is available online,  on the research group website, www.eleseal.org, and regularly updated.  Photo-identification is a very important component of any killer whale (Orcinus orca) study. Killer whales can be identified using natural sign in the saddle patch and in the dorsal fin. Different individuals usually have peculiar scars or notches that permit a  sure identification. Pictures in the catalogue come from different sources: 1) pictures taken at Sea Lion Island by tourists and visitors; 2) pictures taken in other places of the Falklands; 3) pictures taken from recreational vessels, cruise ships and fishing boats. The goal is to provide a unified catalog of all killer whales observed in the Falklands, that can also be used to facilitate the identification of matches with photo-identification catalogues assembled in other places.

It was decided to use the original RAW formant of the camera, avoiding compressed formats (e.g., JPEG) that could generate artifacts. Experienced operators manually matched each good quality pictures with reference pictures of know individuals. Intra- and inter-rater reliability was close to 100% when high quality pictures were examined. The identification process have been carried out until all killer whales present in the observation were identified in at least one picture. If two operators were not able to find a match, a new identity record was created, and the new individual was added to the catalogue. To help identification, the DARWIN software was used to match dorsal fin outlines, but the most of the identification work was carried out manually using signs of the saddle patch.",187477.46,4133693.23,452531.38,4341392.2,UTM 21S WGS84,"Elephant Seal Research Group,

The superficial deposits were kept entirely and where the class ""non-superficial"" occurred it was clipped to the solid geology in order to have the entire land mass of the Falklands covered by interpreted soil types. The solid geology formations were simplified into the following lithological categories: sandstones, sandstones with siltstones and mudstones, mudstones and siltstones, quartzites, tillites and mudstones, granite and gneiss. In order to calculate the Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) for each simplified lithology class, a quarter of the total area of that lithological layer was considered as peat. This was a personal choice but based on a reasonable guess of what occurs in reality. Indeed field surveys will allow this estimation to be reassessed more accurately. Cape Meredith complex was the only lithological class that was not considered peaty because it is too small. Similarly, coverage of peat and other soil types (as percentages) were also estimated for all the superficial geology classes. These soil types cannot be mapped as no soil survey has been carried out in the Falkalnds to allow surveyors to draw boundaries between types. Old auger bores, 186 in number, collected in a minefield feasibility study carried out in 2006, were used in part as ground truthing. The main problem with the auger bore datasets is that they were concentrated in the minefield areas and, therefore, despite giving a good representation of soil types, had a limited spatial distribution and use. Other people's analyses were taken into consideration (e.g. DOA soil samples) but these had very little information about soil types and geographic coordinates were approximate in many sampling locations.",-61.4512,-52.4493,-57.6842,-51.0002,WGS84,"1) Rodney Burton

An image with no cloud cover but with high wave action could not be selected as the marine classification would be impeded. Similarly, an image captured on a calm day with no wave action but cloud over the land could also not be used as the terrestrial classification would be affected. There were a few areas were no perfect image could be sourced, and so a compromise was found. The satellite images were processed to account for satellite noise, the topography of the landscape and atmospheric interference. For the marine classification, further processing was required to reduce the effects of water surface reflection and the decay of light through the water column.",355514.3,4207881.83,451459.72,4304963.2,UTM 21S WGS84,"1) Environment Systems

Surveys of breeding pairs and potential breeding territories were carried out over the two austral summers of 2013 and 2014 and 2014 and 2015. To coincide with the peak breeding period during incubation and small chick rearing periods, work was carried out through November to January. Survey effort was conducted during 6 campaigns, two were undertaken from a yacht and landing on islands, and 4 were dedicated island visits to Steeple Jason (Jan 2013); Sea Lion Island (Jan 2013); Carcass Island (Jan 2013) and Grand Jason (Dec 2014). On land surveys each surveyor was assigned an area of coastline which was walked and a handheld GPS unit used to record waypoints for breeding territories and/or behaviour of adult breeding Striated Caracara. A total of six categories were selected based on previous survey methods (Woods and Smith 1999; Woods 2007) and count of pair was carried out for each category: 1.

In addition to these archipelago wide surveys, three regions were identified as reference sites for more extensive sampling. These comprise the regions of: Stanley & Gypsy Cove on East Falkland, Hill Cove in West Falkland, and Carcass Island. These reference localities were chosen to allow comparison of invertebrate biodiversity of the main native habitat types across East and West Falkland, and a rodent free Island. Within each of these three regions, sites were surveyed in costal margin, oceanic heath and settlement habitats. A variety of sampling methods were employed appropriate to each site and habitat. These comprised: active collecting, including hand capture, sweep-netting, beating, and kick-sampling; trapping, including the use of Malaise traps, light trapping, and pitfall trapping; and laboratory Tullgren funnel extractions. The combined surveys collected tens of thousands of samples comprising anything between 1 and thousands of individual specimens (in the case of mites!).

Data have been collected by JASCO Applied Sciences (JASCO) which conducted a one year static acoustic monitoring programme between July 2012 and August 2013 on behalf of Premier Oil plc in the Sea Lion Development Area (SLDA). 
The aim of the programme was to establish by acoustic means, baseline conditions in terms of the spatial and temporal distribution of resident and transitory marine mammal populations prior to the commencement of oil and gas extraction activity. Additionally, the recording instrumentation was configured to provide high fidelity, calibrated measurements of ambient noise levels and third-party anthropogenic contributions to the soundscape. The acoustic data are provided with a text file including the description of the species and other comments made by Jasco data analysts.

The instruments were deployed on specially designed subsurface moorings in water 410-420 m deep within the SLDA. The final dataset available summarises only the most clear and recognisable, as far as the species is concerned, acoustic files gathered across the whole field campaign. 
Six marine mammal species; 2 baleen whales, 4 toothed whales and 1 pinniped were detected as follows:
Sperm whales; these were the most commonly detected species. Their interaction with the local Patagonian toothfish fishery could explain their regular occurrence.
Fin whales; the second most commonly detected species that could be positively identified, frequently present from August to April.
Pilot whales; commonly detected between April and August
Killer whales; detections were rare and unpredictable. 
Southern right whales; rare but more commonly detected than in previous visual surveys. 
Leopard seals; detected between February and May, with a peak in March and April. 
A further species of odontocete was detected, but its identity remains unclear. This is largely due to incomplete descriptions of the vocal repertoire of species in the area.",-60.2,-54,-53.0002,-49,WGS84,"1) Jasco Applied Sciences

The data were collected during the 2013-2017 breeding seasons. Density and spatial distribution of nests in these two areas were quite different. In 2015-2016 a notable increase in the number of skua nesting pairs compared to the previous season was observed. Breeding success was high, and higher than the one reported for other breeding areas in the Falklands. On the contrary, in 2016-2017 a notable reduction in the number of skua nesting pairs and in the total breeding success of the population compared to the previous season was noted. The reduction in breeding success was stronger in the west end area. The reasons of this general reduction in success, and of the differential impact on the two different breeding areas, are unknown and deserve further investigation. Until now, effect of striated caracara predation, that was previously suggested as a potential regulator of skua demography, have been excluded.

The whole island has been searched to identify skua nests. Skua are territorial, and, therefore, it is usually rather easy to identify nests by observing the behavioral reaction of the adults. After being located, skua nest were mapped using survey-grade GPS receivers (ProMark 3, Magellan). At Sea Lion Island there is a GPS reference station of know position, so sub-metric positions by differential processing can be obtained. Nests were given a serial number, and a stake protruding from the ground a maximum of 2cm, fitted with a 10 cm long, 2 cm wide numbered flag, was placed at a minimum distance of 2 m form the nest, to help locate the nest in following surveys. Pictures of the adults were taken with a DSRL camera fitted with 100-400mm zoom to help visual identification of the members of the pairs. Displaying individuals and pairs were video recorded opportunistically with the same camera. Each nest was surveyed at least weekly, recording number of adults, eggs and chicks present, substrate and general habitat of the nest, aspect of the adults, and reaction towards approaching operators.

The main concern was the effect of UAV flights on wildlife. UAVs can produce a significant low frequency noise, can be attacked by territorial birds, and can adversely affect flying birds at large. All the monitored species showed null to scarce reaction to the UAV and territorial birds (e.g., caracaras) showed a very scarce interest in the flying UAV, much below expectation. The UAV proved very useful to reduce count disturbance in colonial marine birds, permitted us to count affectively the breeding southern sea lions, and produced a quantum leap in our understanding of orcas behaviour, in particular during predation events. With just a small number of flights it was possible to obtain a full imagery coverage of the Sea Lion Island coastline.

This is the first study of elephant seal diving carried out in the Falklands, and complement our previous study carried out with satellite tags to determine female movements, foraging areas and overlap with human activities at sea. We obtained full diving profiles of six females. These diving profiles confirmed the main results of previous studies (satellite tags, stable isotopes analysis) of Sea Lion Island elephant seal females, i.e., the unusually large variability in individual feeding strategies. These females not only choose different foraging areas with very different oceanographic characteristics, but also show a large variation of overall diving profile, maximum depth achieved, and average depth and duration of dives. This is another indication that they have a wide range of feeding strategies, as was suggested by stable isotope analysis.

Along with data from Sea Lion Island, that shelters 100-125 breeding pairs, data on skuas from other islands (Carcass Is., Saunders Is., Bleaker Is., Pebble Is. and Islet, and Steeple Jason Is.) have been collected in 2016-2017.  Pairs and nests have been identified and recorded adult and chick vocalizations in all studied sites, obtaining a large sample of good quality recordings. Skuas were found to have a complex vocal communication system, that there is individual variation in vocal behaviour and vocal reactivity of different individuals, and that calls have important individual features. A preliminary vocal repertoire for the species has been drafted, and we found that the contact call seems to be the best part of the repertoire to study individual recognition. The quantitative analysis of individual and geographic variation is currently in progress, and more field work and recordings will be carried out in 2017-2018.

The recordins is mostly of adults, but whenever possible chicks were also recorded. Recording were performed by carefully approaching the animals at the nest, which usually elicits a vocal response. Great care was taken to avoid adverse behavioural effects (abandonment of nests) and to reduce the duration of the solicitation to a minimum. During each audio recording session the kind of calls emitted by the different individuals and their behaviour and reaction to the approach was noted down. Recordings of calls were carried out using digital recorders (Marantz PMD 660) and directional microphones (Sennheiser MD-441 and ME-67). Displaying individuals and pairs were video recorded opportunistically with the same camera. Recordings were transferred to a mobile workstation (Dell M4700) and processed using acoustic analysis software. Waveforms, power spectra, and spectrograms were calculated and visualized in Raven (version 1.5). Fundamental frequency tracking was carried out in Praat.
